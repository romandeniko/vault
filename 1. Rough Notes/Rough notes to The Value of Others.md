#### Chapter 1
[page 11]
People are either a **solution** or a **problem**.
They're a problem when they have things we want but they don't give us these things.
They're a solution when they have and give us what we want.
**People are often a problem.**
To fix the problem of others, people devised three ways:
* *Move against others*, i.e. take what's needed by force.
* *Move away from others*, i.e. avoid any need of interaction.
* *Move towards other*, i.e. collaborate to get what they want
The first two approaches are **antisocial**, although antisocial doesn't always mean bad. The third approach works when promising to give what people want in the future. 
Also, the third approach involves people joining others because they want things that other people have, i.e. there is no relationship between people who **lack and desire** the same thing.
[page 12]
People may want different things but can be aligned in terms of a common goal. This is due to the complementarity of their skills.
The **relationship** is formed when people exchange what they have and want.
**A person who has more things the other people want will have more relationship opportunities.**
A relationship exists only if **the value** is transacted.
People only approach those who they want to get the benefit from.
If they feel they won't get benefits, they try to avoid people to get away from harm; otherwise, they simply behave indifferently.
**The main motivation to form a relationship is a transacted value. If no value is transacted, there is no relationship.**
Value is a subject to constant fluctuation. It exists in the valuer's mind. The valuation happens beneath the threshold of awareness: you don't truly know your own valuation and the other's valuation of the thing exchanged.
*A value can be a simple pleasure of the other's company or an escape from the guilt associated with not discharging a duty.*
[page 13]
Valuations must be comparable. So, **the relationship is the media in which different goods of comparable value are exchanged.**
Since the goods are unequal and subjective, the relationship must be negotiated throughout the entire length. In professional relationships the negotiation is quite **overt**. In relations with friends and lovers the relationships are negotiated **covertly**.
Relationships have rules and laws. Rules depend on the culture an can be broken. For example, you can't talk badly about your friends behind their backs. If the rule is broken, you face interpersonal consequences, i.e. the relationship is over. Laws are more biologically determined and are much more difficult to break.
[page14]
Example: there is a law that relationships are formed when people transact unequal goods of comparable value. If goods have the same value, the transaction is impossible/unnecessary, i.e. no relationship is formed. If there is a mismatch in values, the relationship is also unlikely to form. If the law is violated and the relationship is formed, this can lead to a lot of distress to the under-compensated party (intrapersonal consequence).
Rules, laws, and people's objectives give rise to **the game of relationships**. A game has rules and a goal.
In the game of relationships a goal is to get what they want from others without violating the rules. If people get too little of what they want/too much of what they don't want, they stop playing.
Every type of relationship constitutes a different game and a game with one individual may be different from a game with another.
[page 15]
**A sexual relationship is when at least on of the goods transacted is sex.**
Sex can be the objective or an instrument to achieve another goal.
People get into sexual relationships by playing *the game of mating and dating.*
This game also have laws and rules.
People enter into sexual relationships with their perceived best options. So, *the perception of value* is the mechanism that lies at the base of sexual relationships.
[page 16]
Thus, the game of mating and dating is a synthesis of psychological and economic principles, i.e. it is informed by perception and enacted according to the value exchange principles. This is called *behavioral economics*. The economic model clarifies the reasons behind the emotions that motivate people to form relationships.

**The explanation of value**
Value is something people are willing to spend their resources for. Value fluctuates, and there are two main drivers of fluctuation: goal-relevance and information. Human experience is a set of nested games: the game of making a presentation is embedded in the game of a job, which is embedded in the game of money, which is embedded in the game of society, which is embedded in the game of survival. Which game is more important at a time depends on the never-ending stream of information through our changing perception of the present moment.
People determine the value of a specific good based on:
1. Its scarcity.
2. Its instrumentality in achieving a personally relevant goal
3. The importance of that goal in the nested hierarchy of games.
In reality the process is much more complicated: the value is extremely complex calculation of evaluation mediated by perception, memory, and imagination.
